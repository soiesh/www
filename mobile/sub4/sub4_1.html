									We invite young people who are not afraid of failure and who have the spirit and determination to challenge success. Creative failure is a privilege of youth. We value the active and active spirit of challenge that can find the possibility of success even in failure more than the stability that we can find the possibility of success even in failure.

									<span> A young man who knows cooperation and co-prosperity. </span> 
									True talent should have the virtue of cooperating and yielding. I think we can warm up this society by gathering gratitude for the people and society we live together. Developing each person's abilities and skills is also a job for individuals and companies, but Lotte waits for young people who understand their roles as social beings. Invest your young and grand dreams in Lotte. Lotte, which is constantly advancing and growing, will make your beautiful future.
